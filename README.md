basic script that randomly says "wow" from the computer's speakers. designed as easily-installable beneware for my wife's computer

install via:

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrennanColberg/wow/refs/heads/main/install.sh" | bash
```

(tested on macOS, I don't think the `say` command is common elsewhere)
